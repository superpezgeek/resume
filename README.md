# Resume

This is a simple project for my resume.  It started off as just a simple HTML page, but I incorporated AngularJS to make it simple enough for anyone to display their resume in this format.

## Bower

This project uses Bower to manage Angular, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome.  Make sure you run

        bower install

if you want to use this project.
